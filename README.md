# La Voie de la Pastèque

**La Voie de la Pastèque** is a high school project made by myself and two classmates. This game is a visual novel made with Ren'py and Python. 
  
[**You can download the compressed folder of the game here.**](https://github.com/chengzhe-wang/La-Voie-de-la-Pasteque/raw/main/LaVoieDeLaPasteque.zip)  
Once extracted, you have to launch *LaVoiedelaPasteque.exe* then you can enjoy the game.
  
During the game, there will be three portals : this is where we separated our work. Every portal leads to a part of the game that each of us created independently. For example, the portal with the letter "C" is the part that I made as the "C" stands for Chengzhe.  

## Start of the game
As the game starts, you wake up facing a talking watermelon, the *God of Watermelons*. Soon after, your memories slowly come back and you realise that you were escaping a murderer.

While running away, you eventually get into a portal room with three different portals. In order to make it out alive, you have to quickly chose one. Chose the blue portal to see my work.

## Blue portal

After entering the blue portal, you get teleported in another world. A world filled with desert. This place looks empty, you see nothing except sand, cactuses and... a strange creature. Its name is *A3T* and you quickly become friends since you are both escaping the murderer.  
As you keep running away, you run into two buildings : a **pyramid** and a **tower**. You will have to solve different puzzles in order to go further away.
