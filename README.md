# La Voie de la Pastèque

**La Voie de la Pastèque** is a high school project made by myself and two classmates. This game is a visual novel made with Ren'py and Python. 
  
[**You can download the compressed folder of the game here.**](https://github.com/chengzhe-wang/La-Voie-de-la-Pasteque/raw/main/LaVoieDeLaPasteque.zip) Once extracted, you have to launch *LaVoiedelaPasteque.exe* then you can enjoy the game.
  
During the game, there will be three portals : this is where we separated our work. Every portal leads to a part of the game that each of us created independently. For example, the portal with the letter "C" is the part that I made as the "C" stands for Chengzhe.  

As the game starts, you will wake up facing a living watermelon, the *God of Watermelons*. Soon after, your memories are slowly coming back and you'll realise that you were escaping a murderer.

While running away, you will eventually get into a portal room with three different portals. In order to make it out alive, you will have to quickly chose one. Chose the blue portal to see my work.
